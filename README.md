* Update with a setup script (either per tool or one master shell script)
* Set up symbolic links for you
* Detail additional steps for custom env
<!-- Make sure to put in some work and document the process to add the specific tools -->
<!-- document exact steps in order to better fill this out and install anywhere testing on different distro -->
<!-- Don't just reply on the set up scripts you have -->
<!-- Git settings and install as well (more personal use) -->

## Scripts 

* Break down the different scripts

    * Then extract and put it into path 
    * ~/.local/bin (default)
* Google and duck for lynx

## Vim

* .vimrc -> users home dir 
* VIMPLUGINSTALL script (needs to run to load vim plugins)
* Look at adding shellcheck plugin 
* Can use entr also but worth diving into alittle deeper

## Bashrc
