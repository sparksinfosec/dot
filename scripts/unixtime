# Need to convert inputed epoch timestamp and convert it to human readable 
# Need to spit the current date/time out into a unix timestap
# Need to take in a date (format?) and time and then conver to unix timestamp 

#date -d "06/10/2024 07:21:23" +"%s"
#date --date=@1718004083
# Correct form of the date command from standard MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS to epoch 
# And from epoch to a date and time 
# Does time zone matter hear tool will be used basically to get what date or time the epoch timestamp is?
